= Overview

We will use some terms in this document:

* The word *cache* will be used for the local repository (`$HOME/.m2/repository`).

== Overview of the Current Situation

=== Maven Invoker Plugin

In {maven-invoker-plugin} the following issues exist:

* Parallelizing does not work and is not easy to integrate based on
  current concept and code base.
** Apart from being implemented it would hard to express the prevention
of parallel execution in some situations.
* Separating caches for each build is hard to implement
* Get a common cache for a set of integration tests is even harder.
* A Concept like `BeforeEach` or `BeforeAll` is current not really possible.
** The concept with `setup` project is not correctly working at the moment.
* Writing integration tests forces one to write in Groovy or Beanshell.
** This means to enhance the number of dependencies. In days of Java 5 until 7 it had been an
advantage to use Groovy with it's supports for closures etc. which made it simpler and easier
to write things for integration tests, but since JDK 8 it is not necessary anymore.
* Integrationtests are not that expressive as they should be.
* Violation of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns[separation of concern paradigm]
** Conditions
*** Assertions are hard to express cause one implicit assertion is that a build will be successful
*** Conditions for the execution of a test for example are:
**** should be executed only on JDK11
**** should be executed only on Maven 3.3.9 and above
**** Several other conditions
*** are expressed within a single file https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-invoker-plugin/integration-test-mojo.html#invokerPropertiesFile[`invoker.properties`].

=== Maven Verifier Plugin

The https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-verifier-plugin/[Maven Verifier Plugin] is intended to
write tests to check for the existence of files or the absence of files but in the end it is
very limited.

The {maven-verifier} is intended to write integration tests for Maven ...

//TODO: Enhance here with more details?

=== Maven Verifier Component

The {maven-verifier} is intended to write a kind of tests:

* You can set the command line parameters for an executed instance of Maven like `-s`, `-X` etc.
* Execute goals like `package` or a like.
* It contains some methods like `assertFilePresent`, `assertFileMatches`,
   `verifyArtifactPresence` etc. but not a comprehensive set of methods.
* Some parts are like Maven Invoker Plugin for example starting an external
process with Maven (something like starting Maven on command line.).

=== Maven Plugin Testing Harness

The {maven-plugin-testing-harness}is intended to write tests for using parameters correctly and
several other setup situations but the test setup is separated into a unit test like part in code
and a part which is pom like

* It's bound to versions of Maven core which might caused issues during testing with other versions
  of Maven.

//TODO: RECONSIDER this content...

=== Why not Spock?

So you might ask why not using Spock or any other testing framework for such purposes?
Let me summarize the different aspects I had in mind:

* People often tend to write Java code (which is valid), cause
they don't know Groovy or don't want to learn a new language
just to write tests. This means in the end: Why Groovy? Just use Java.
* It's much easier for new contributors/devs to get into the
project if you only need to know Java to write plugins, unit
tests and integration tests. So removing a supplemental
hurdle will help.
* Support for most recent Java versions which is a complete
blocker for the Apache Maven project, cause the Apache Maven Project is  running builds
in a very early stage which would block us (see our builds for example {maven-ear-plugin-build}).
Currently spock is not yet tested/build against JDK11+ ?
So having a Testing framework which might not work on most
recent versions is a complete blocker.
* In earlier days I would have argued to use Spock based
on the language features but since JDK8 I don't see any advantage
in using Groovy over Java anymore.
* Spock does not support parallelizing of tests (full blocker for me)
* Good IDE Support for Groovy is at the moment only given in
IDEA IntelliJ as well as for DSL support for Spock.
That would block many people. This blocker based on the usage
of a particular IDE is not acceptable for an open source project
like the Apache Maven Project and from my own point of view as
an Apache Maven PMC member this is simply a no go.

=== Conclusion

It is needed to have a combination of {maven-invoker-plugin}, Maven Verifier etc. into
a single Testing framework which should make it possible to make integration tests
easier to write and make them more expressive about what the intention of a tests exactly is.

It looks like a good solution to use existing frameworks like {junit-jupiter} and assertions like
{assertj} library to express what it's needed. This in result will give automatically
many advantages for example the integration into the IDE as well as writing the tests in
Java code and furthermore opens easy ways to use existing Java libraries.

Using {junit-jupiter} as base will solve a lot things which are already supported by {junit-jupiter}
like conditional execution of Tests based on JRE or possible deactivation based on
properties etc.

Based on {assertj} it could be easy to express the assertions for test results in many ways and can
also being enhanced by writing custom assertions.

== Basic Idea
The expressiveness of tests is a very important part of writing integration tests or
test in general. If a test is not easy to understand it is very likely not being written.

Lets take a look into the following code snippet which is an idea how an integration
test for a {maven-plugins}/Maven Extensions/Maven-Core could look like:
[source,java]
----
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenIT;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenTest;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenProjectResult;

@MavenIT
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest
  void the_first_test_case(MavenProjectResult result) {
    assertThat(result)
      .build()
        .isSuccessful()
      .and()
      .project()
        .hasTarget()
          .withEarFile()
            .containsOnlyOnce("META-INF/MANIFEST.MF")
        .log()
          .info().contains("Writing data to file")
      .cache()
          .withEarFile("G:A:V")
          .withPomFile("G:A:V")
          .withMetadata().contains("xxx");
  }
}
----

== Concept

The idea was to create an {junit-jupiter-extension} which will support writing of
integration tests for Maven plugins etc. in a convenient way. Furthermore writing custom assertions
with {assertj} library makes it easier to express the intention of a test.

//TODO: Also thinking of the integration tests of Maven Core itself.

Basic Idea is currently similar to maven-invoker-plugin:
Another option would be to combine this with Docker containers which run Maven.
Extension starts the appropriate Maven version via ProcessBuilder with parameters in it's own directory
(`target/maven-it/ ...` )

//TODO: The following is currently not true!
//Setups which are needed can be defined via `@BeforeEach` or `@BeforeAll` (NEED TO THINK ABOUT IT) annotated methods in JUnit Jupiter.

 * Separate

 * Existing repository which contains already installed artifacts for
   special cases (see {github-versions-maven-plugin} a lot of test cases need special artifacts in
   repository for integration tests). Using a directory default: `local-repo`. ?

== Example

The following integration test is a basic skeleton of an integration test which implies some conventions
which will be describe within the following paragraphs.

[source,java]
.FirstIT.java
----
package org.it;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenIT;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenTest;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenExecutionResult;

@MavenIT
class FirstIT {

  @MavenTest
  void first(MavenExecutionResult result) {
  }

  @MavenTest
  void second(MavenExecutionResult result) {
  }
}
----

The directory structure of an integration test will look like this. This is by convention the same
as for any kind of unit- or integration-test in Maven or more in general in Java projects.
[source,text]
----
src
 +-- test
      +-- java
            +-- org
                 +-- it
                      +-- FirstIT.java
----
//TODO: Reconsider the following paragraph (content? move to somewhere else)
The convention is simply by mapping the method name (including the package name) into a directory.
The `resources` directory is the location where to find the project for the integration tests. Basic
start is the class name `FirstIT` which defines the base directory for all test cases.


In Ma
//TODO: May be we need to reconsider the following? Just remove this directory?
The intermediate directory `maven-its` is intended to separate the usual resources from the
integration test resources.
[source,text]
----
src
 +-- test
      +-- resources
            +-- maven-its
                +-- org
                     +-- it
                          +-- FirstIT
----


Now we have the need to separate each test case from each other which is done via the method name of
the test case within the test class  `FirstIT` which has the methods `first` and `second` in our
examples. This will look like the following:
[source,text]
----
src
 +-- test
      +-- resources
            +-- maven-its
                +-- org
                     +-- it
                          +-- FirstIT
                                +- first
                                     +- src
                                     +- pom.xml
                                +- second
                                     +- src
                                     +- pom.xml
----
During the execution of the integration tests the following directories will be created within the
`target` directory:
[source,text]
----
target
 +- maven-its
        +- org
           +- it
              +- FirstIT
                  +- first
                        +- .m2/
                        +- project
                        +- mvn-stdout.log
                        +- mvn-stderr.log
                        +- other logs
                  +- second
                        +- .m2/
                        +- project
                        +- mvn-stdout.log
                        +- mvn-stderr.log
                        +- other logs
----
Based on the above you can see that each test case (method within the class) has it's own
local cache (`.m2/repository`). You see the resulting project is built within the `project` folder
to make separated from log files and local cache. The result of this setup is that each
//TODO: The following needs to be checked by having parallelize on per class base or on test case base?
test case is completely separated from each other test case and gives us an easy way to parallelize
the integration test cases in a simple way.


It is possible to define the cache for several test cases globally which can simply being done by
using the following annotation parameter `mavenCache=MavenCache.Global`.
This give the opportunity to make different tests share the same cache which is like a usual setup
for a user on a local machine which can be used to test different scenarios.
The other possible value is the default which is `mavenCache=MavenCache.Local` which means having
the cache locally to each test case. This will separate each integration test case from each other.

[source,java]
.FirstMavenIT.java
----
package org.it;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenIT;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenTest;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenCache;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenExecutionResult;

@MavenIT(mavenCache = MavenCache.Global)
class FirstIT {

  @MavenTest
  void first(MavenExecutionResult result) {
  }

  @MavenTest
  void second(MavenExecutionResult result) {
  }
}
----

Sometimes it could be useful to setup a number of project together to test things related to
usage of other other artifacts or other projects etc. this can be achieved by using the following
setup:
[source,java]
.MavenIntegrationIT.java
----
package org.it;
import static org.apache.maven.jupiter.assertj.MavenITAssertions.assertThat;

import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenIT;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenTest;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenCache;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenExecutionResult;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.MethodOrderer.OrderAnnotation;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Order;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.TestMethodOrder;

@MavenIT(mavenCache = MavenCache.Global)
@TestMethodOrder(OrderAnnotation.class)
class MavenIntegrationIT {

  @MavenTest(goals = {"install"})
  @Order(10)
  void setup(MavenExecutionResult result) {
    assertThat(result).isSuccessful();
  }

  @MavenTest(goals = {"install"})
  @Order(20)
  void setup_2(MavenExecutionResult result) {
    assertThat(result).isSuccessful();
  }

  @MavenTest
  void first_integration_test(MavenExecutionResult result) {
    assertThat(result).isSuccessful();
  }
}
----
Based on the given annotation with parameters `@MavenIT(mavenCache = MavenCache.Global)` this will
define a global cache for each of the test cases within the given test class `MavenIntegrationIT`.

So based on the above test case you will get a resulting directory structure which looks like this:
[source,text]
----
target
 +- maven-its
        +- org
           +- it
              +- MavenIntegrationIT
                  +- .m2/
                  +- setup
                        +- project
                        +- mvn-stdout.log
                        +- mvn-stderr.log
                        +- other logs
                  +- setup_2
                        +- project
                        +- mvn-stdout.log
                        +- mvn-stderr.log
                        +- other logs
                  +- first_integration_test
                        +- project
                        +- mvn-stdout.log
                        +- mvn-stderr.log
                        +- other logs
----
There are two things to mention. First the cache which is common for all given tests cases
`setup`, `setup_2` and for `first_integration_test`. Furthermore the definition of the order of
execution given by using `@Order(10)` which defines the order of execution for those test cases which
are used as setup projects for the real test case `first_integration_test`. This makes it easy
possible define any kind of setup projects for a bigger complexer test case.

//TODO: Need to reconsider using @BeforeEach as a setup before each test case? How to handle the cash ?
// directory structure?






Separate repository which contains already installed artifacts `local-repo`:

Think how to make the build use it?

                          +-- FirstIT

== Execution of Maven itself

* How to get the Maven version which is defined?
** Define within the same pom file you run your tests?
** Ok could be downloaded from Central?
** how to handle repository managers?
* Where to get configured all the avialble Maven versions?
On the system?
or should we simply download it always to be sure?

== Parameter Injection

Possible options:

* Information about the built project
** version, GAV etc. maybe the whole POM tree ?
** think more in details?
* Logging output
** Stdout
** StdErr
** Log Output as Stream or after finished running
** Convenience methods to get information from the log
*** `isInfo()` which relates to `[INFO] ..` Think about this?
*** Some things to get output from plugins etc.???
* Access to the cache directory
** With convenience methods to access artifacts/content of artifacts
** ???
* general build result.

=== MavenExecutionResult

* MavenExecutionResult
** isSuccessful() `BUILD SUCCESS`
** isError() `[ERROR]....`
** is

[source,java]
.ThirdMavenIT.java
----
@MavenIT
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest
  void first_test_case(MavenExecutionResult execResult) {
    assertThat(execResult).isSuccessful();
  }
  @MavenTest
  void second_test_case(MavenExecutionResult execResult) {
    assertThat(execResult).isFailed();
  }

}
----

=== Run Conditionally Integration Tests

You might want to run an integration test only for a particular Maven version for example running
only for Maven 3.6.0?

[source,java]
.ForthMavenIT.java
----
import static org.apache.maven.jupiter.assertj.MavenExecutionResultAssert.assertThat;
import static org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenVersion.M3_0_5;
import static org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenVersion.M3_6_0;

import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.DisabledForMaven;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.EnabledForMaven;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenIT;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenTest;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenExecutionResult;

@MavenIT
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest
  @EnabledForMaven(M3_6_0)
  void first_test_case(MavenExecutionResult execResult) {
    assertThat(execResult).isSuccessful();
  }

  @DisabledForMaven(M3_0_5)
  @MavenTest
  void second_test_case(MavenExecutionResult execResult) {
    assertThat(execResult).isFailed();
  }

}
----

So not run some tests on particular Java version can be handled via usual JUnit Jupiter things like:

[source,java]
.FivthMavenIT.java
----
@MavenIT
@DisabledOnJre(JAVA_10)
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest
  @EnabledForMaven(M3_6_0)
  void first_test_case(MavenExecutionResult execResult) {
    assertThat(execResult).isSuccessful();
  }

  @DisabledForMaven(M3_0_5)
  @MavenTest
  void second_test_case(MavenExecutionResult execResult) {
    assertThat(execResult).isFailed();
  }
}
----



== Assertions in Maven Tests

What kind of assertions do we need to express:

 * Build itself has successfully ended or failed. (Return code? enough?)
 * Log File contains several information
 ** Different levels `INFO`,  `WARN` or `ERROR`..
 *** contains simply one or more lines text
 *** contains only once or multiple appearance of texts
 * StdErr output contains particular output or should not contain particular output.
 * The `target` directory of the built project contains
   either:
 ** particular files
 *** simply exist/do not exist?
 *** should exist or should not exist
 *** The files contain particular content? for example or in general directory within
     the file `MANIFEST.MF`.
 *** A packaged file  special content?
 ** directories
 ** ??

        .module("G:A:V")
          hasTarget().withJarFile().metainf
  }
}
----


=== Target Directory Handling

[source,java]
.SeventhMavenIT.java
----
import static org.apache.maven.jupiter.assertj.MavenProjectResultAssert.assertThat;

import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenIT;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenTest;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenProjectResult;

@MavenIT
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest
  void second_test_case(MavenProjectResult project) {
    assertThat(project).hasTarget()
        .withEarFile()
        .containsOnlyOnce(
            "META-INF/application.xml",
            "META-INF/appserver-application.xml"
        );
  }

  @MavenTest
  void third_test_case(MavenProjectResult project) {
    assertThat(project).hasTarget()
        .withEarFile()
        .doesNotContain("commons-io-1.4.jar")
        .containsOnlyOnce(
            "commons-lang-commons-lang-2.5.jar",
            "META-INF/application.xml",
            "META-INF/MANIFEST.MF"
        );
  }
}
----

=== New Ideas

The basic idea is to have the assertions based on an entry point which is
`MavenExecutionResultAssert` related to `MavenExecutionResult`.


The following are example how an integration test could look like:

[source,java]
.UnknownMavenIT.java
----
import static org.apache.maven.jupiter.assertj.MavenProjectResultAssert.assertThat;

import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenIT;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.MavenTest;
import org.apache.maven.jupiter.extension.maven.MavenProjectResult;

@MavenIT
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest
  void third_test_case(MavenProjectResult project) {
    assertThat(project)
      .hasCache()
        .withEarFile("G:A:V").containsOnlyOnce("...")
        .withJarFile("...").contains("..")
        .withPomFile("g:a:v:c").containsDependency("xxx")
        .withArchive(".tar.gz").contains("...");
    assertThat(project).log().contains("...")
    assertThat(project).hasModule("A:G").hasTarget().withEarFile()....
    assertThat(project).build().isSuccessful().hasTarget()
  }
}
----




=== Things which do not work yet (not complete!)

* [ ] I can't define a version within the goals at the moment? See the following example:
+
[source,java]
.UnknownMavenIT.java
----
@MavenIT
class FirstMavenIT {

  @MavenTest(goals={"clean org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-assembly-plugin:${project.version}:single"})
  void third_test_case(MavenProjectResult project) {
    assertThat(project)
      ...
  }
}
----

Later we will create an plugin for the purpose an can inject the information into the test cases as
we already did like in {maven-invoker-plugin}.


This is:

 * Currently it is not possible to define the version Maven only within the test case.
Unfortunately we have to define it in the Maven pom which is used to download the needed package from Central.


== TODO List

 * Testing parallization looks already very good. The following run is using parallel execution
 of the tests:
